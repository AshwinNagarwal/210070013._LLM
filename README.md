# A Practical Introduction to LLMs:

## What is an LLM?
LLM stands for Large Language Model, a recent AI innovation popularized by ChatGPT in December 2022. Unlike traditional chatbots, LLMs exhibit unique emergent properties like zero-shot learning due to their large number of parameters. These models can perform tasks without specific training, setting them apart from previous AI paradigms.

## What Makes an LLM ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù?
LLMs have 10‚Äì100 billion parameters, leading to emergent properties like zero-shot learning, enabling them to perform tasks without explicit training. This makes them significantly different from smaller language models, as they display advanced capabilities when they reach a certain size.

## How Do LLMs Work?
LLMs are trained using word prediction. When models reach around 10 billion parameters, they exhibit emergent abilities like zero-shot learning, making them versatile and powerful. This training method is similar to smaller models, but the scale of LLMs enables advanced features and capabilities.

## 3 Levels of Using LLMs

### Level 1: Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves using LLMs out-of-the-box, either through user-friendly UIs like ChatGPT or directly via APIs for more customization. This method is accessible and economical but may lack advanced functionalities and scalability required for larger applications.

### Level 2: Model Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning tweaks an existing LLM's parameters for specific tasks using high-quality labeled data, requiring more expertise and resources than prompt engineering. This approach allows for better optimization for particular use cases, providing improved performance over generic models.

### Level 3: Build Your Own LLM
Building an LLM from scratch involves creating custom training data and model parameters, demanding significant computational resources and expertise. This method offers ultimate flexibility and customization for specific applications but requires extensive time, budget, and technical skills.


# API Overview

##  What‚Äôs an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows interaction with a remote application programmatically, akin to texting a friend for recommendations. APIs use programming languages like Python or JavaScript to automate information retrieval from external sources, essential for software development requiring external data.

##  OpenAI‚Äôs (Python) API
OpenAI‚Äôs API enables interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT via Python, providing access to powerful ML models without provisioning computational resources. It supports customizable system messages, input parameters, file inclusion, word embeddings, audio transcription, and model fine-tuning.

##  Getting Started (4 Steps)
To use OpenAI's API, follow these steps:

**1. Make an Account**-Sign up on the OpenAI API Overview page for a $5 API credit for the first three months. Existing ChatGPT users can log in.

**2. Add Payment Method**-If the free credit expires, add a payment method under the "Billing" tab in your profile.

**3. Set Usage Limits**-Set soft and hard usage limits under the "Billing" tab to control your spending.

**4. Get API Secret Key**-Generate a secret key under "View API keys" to authenticate your API calls.

##  Example Code: Chat Completion API
Learn to use OpenAI's Python library for chat completion, adjusting parameters like max tokens, number of responses, and temperature to optimize model outputs. This involves setting up system messages and utilizing user and assistant roles for context-specific responses.

# What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is an AI company that has become a major hub for open-source machine learning (ML). Their platform offers three main resources: a repository of pre-trained ML models, a library of datasets for training models, and Spaces, a collection of open-source ML apps. These community-generated resources leverage the benefits of open-source, making powerful ML projects more accessible. The key element of Hugging Face is the Transformers library.

## ü§óTransformers

Transformers is a Python library that simplifies downloading and training state-of-the-art ML models. Initially for language models, it now includes models for computer vision, audio processing, and more. It integrates easily with Hugging Face's repositories and supports other ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. This creates a versatile platform for ML models and apps.

## Pipeline()

The pipeline() function abstracts various ML tasks into one line of code. It simplifies complex processes like sentiment analysis, summarization, translation, and more. By coding with pipeline(), we learn how to efficiently implement and utilize these tasks in machine learning projects.

## Models

Hugging Face hosts a vast repository of pre-trained models (277,528 at the time of writing). These models are compatible with various ML frameworks beyond Transformers, making them valuable to a wide range of ML practitioners. By exploring and implementing different models, we learn how to tailor ML solutions to specific tasks and frameworks.

## Example Code: NLP with ü§óTransformers

Through coding examples, we learn practical applications of the Transformers library, covering sentiment analysis, summarization, and conversational text generation. Engaging in these coding activities helps us understand the library's functionalities and their real-world applications.

## Chatbot UI with Gradio

Gradio allows us to create intuitive front-end interfaces for ML models. By building a chatbot UI, we learn how to make model interactions more user-friendly and accessible. This process demonstrates the integration of Gradio with the Transformers library and enhancing our understanding of deploying ML models.

## Hugging Face Spaces

Hugging Face Spaces provide a platform for deploying ML apps with ease. By creating and configuring a new Space, we learn how to leverage Hugging Face's hosting capabilities for our ML applications. This step-by-step process empowers us to deploy our projects effectively using the Gradio SDK.
