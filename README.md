# API Overview

##  What’s an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows interaction with a remote application programmatically, akin to texting a friend for recommendations. APIs use programming languages like Python or JavaScript to automate information retrieval from external sources, essential for software development requiring external data.

##  OpenAI’s (Python) API
OpenAI’s API enables interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT via Python, providing access to powerful ML models without provisioning computational resources. It supports customizable system messages, input parameters, file inclusion, word embeddings, audio transcription, and model fine-tuning.

##  Getting Started (4 Steps)
To use OpenAI's API, follow these steps:

###  Make an Account
Sign up on the OpenAI API Overview page for a $5 API credit for the first three months. Existing ChatGPT users can log in.

###  Add Payment Method
If the free credit expires, add a payment method under the "Billing" tab in your profile.

###  Set Usage Limits
Set soft and hard usage limits under the "Billing" tab to control your spending.

###  Get API Secret Key
Generate a secret key under "View API keys" to authenticate your API calls.

##  Example Code: Chat Completion API
Learn to use OpenAI's Python library for chat completion, adjusting parameters like max tokens, number of responses, and temperature to optimize model outputs. This involves setting up system messages and utilizing user and assistant roles for context-specific responses.
